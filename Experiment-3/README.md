# 🧪 Experiment: Study of lists and its various operations on it

---

## 🎯 Aim
To understand and implement the concept of **lists in Python** and perform fundamental list operations using built-in methods.

---

## 📘 Description
Lists are a fundamental data structure in Python used to store multiple values in a single variable.  
They are **mutable**, allowing modification of elements after creation.  
This experiment demonstrates the practical usage of lists through simple Python programs executed in Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Creating and initializing lists  
- Accessing elements using indexing  
- Updating and deleting elements  
- Traversing lists using loops  
- Common list methods:
  - `append()`
  - `insert()`
  - `remove()`
  - `pop()`
  - `sort()`
  - `len()`

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📂 Files Included
- 📄 `practical3.ipynb` – Contains Python programs demonstrating list operations

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes
After completing this experiment, the learner will be able to:
- Understand the structure and use of lists in Python  
- Perform basic list operations efficiently  
- Apply built-in list methods in programs  
- Use lists for storing and manipulating collections of data  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Lists provide an efficient and flexible way to manage collections of data in Python.  
This experiment establishes a foundation for applying lists in more advanced programming concepts.
