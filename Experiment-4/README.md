# 🧪 Experiment: Tuples in Python

---

## 🎯 Aim
To study and implement the concept of **tuples in Python** and perform fundamental operations such as creation, accessing elements, and applying commonly used tuple methods.

---

## 📘 Description
Tuples are an important built-in data structure in Python used to store multiple values in a single variable.  
Unlike lists, tuples are **immutable**, meaning their elements cannot be modified after creation.

This experiment demonstrates the usage of tuples through practical Python programs.

---

## 📖 Theory (Tuples in Python)

A **tuple** is an ordered collection of elements enclosed in parentheses `()`.

### 🔹 Key Characteristics of Tuples
- **Ordered**: Elements maintain a fixed sequence.
- **Immutable**: Once created, elements cannot be added, removed, or changed.
- **Heterogeneous**: Tuples can store different data types together.
- **Allows duplicates**: Same value can appear multiple times.
- **Efficient**: Tuples are more memory-efficient and slightly faster than lists.

### 🔹 Why Tuples are Used
Tuples are preferred when:
- Data should remain constant and protected from modification  
- A fixed collection of values needs to be stored  
- Returning multiple values from a function  
- Using elements as dictionary keys (tuples are hashable)

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Creating and initializing tuples  
- Accessing elements using indexing  
- Understanding tuple immutability  
- Traversing tuples using loops  
- Common tuple methods:
  - `count()`
  - `index()`  
- Difference between lists and tuples

## 🛠 Tools Used
- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📂 Files Included
- 📄 `<tuple_experiment>.ipynb` – Contains Python programs demonstrating tuple operations  

---

## 🏁 Conclusion
Tuples provide a secure and efficient way to store collections of data that should not be modified.  
This experiment helps in understanding immutable data structures and their applications in Python programming.
